## Properties

### highWaterMark

â€¢ **highWaterMark**: `number`

Creates a new ByteLengthQueuingStrategy with the provided high water mark.

Note that the provided high water mark will not be validated ahead of time. Instead, if it is negative, NaN, or not a number, the resulting ByteLengthQueuingStrategy will cause the corresponding stream constructor to throw.
